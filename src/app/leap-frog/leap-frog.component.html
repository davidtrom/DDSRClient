        <div id="route-text">
            A leap from pond-to-pond in central and southern Delaware. The courses are laid out to offer a unique look at the beautiful wet and dry scenery of central and lower Delaware. 
            Ride routes are mostly flat. There are two rest stops for the full metric century ride and one for the half metric century. Rest room facilities, food and drink will be available at all stops and the finish.  
            SAG support is provided.

<h2><u>Cue Sheets</u></h2>
    <div class="text">
        Both routes are defined by the yellow frog markings on the road. The two route splits are well marked by both frog markers, distances and signs. 
        You don’t have to decide which route you’ll take until the first route split at about 14 miles. You may vary your distance at either point. 
        There are four or more frogs marking each turn. A warning frog before the turn, another warning frog near the turn and a frog marking the turn. A further confirmation frog always appears after the turn. 
        <strong><u>Follow the frogs.</u></strong>
